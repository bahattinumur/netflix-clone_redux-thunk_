<h1>NETFLIX CLONE _redux-thunk_</h1>

This is a project for a NETFLIX CLONE built with Redux-Thunk. In this project developed with the flexibility of Redux-Thunk, data is retrieved from https://api.themoviedb.org, showcasing movies across a variety of genres including Action, Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Family, Fantasy, History, Horror, Music, Mystery, Romance, Science Fiction, TV Movie, Thriller, War, and Western. Users can dynamically explore movies within their preferred genre using a slider. Upon clicking on a movie, users can delve into additional details such as Production Companies, Languages, Production Countries, a brief overview of the film, budget, income, cast, and at the bottom, the movie trailer.
